<h1 align="center"> 8WeekSQLChallenge </h1> <br>

The 8WeekSQLChallenge is a structured learning program created by Danny Ma that aims to help individuals enhance their SQL (Structured Query Language) skills in a practical and engaging way. It consists of a series of eight challenges, each designed to simulate real-world data analysis scenarios and business problems. Each week, I'll tackle a new challenge that builds upon what I've learned in previous weeks.

## Introduction

The goal of the challenge is to guide participants through progressively more complex SQL exercises over the course of eight weeks. Here's how the challenge works:

1. Learning Path: The challenge is divided into eight weeks, with each week dedicated to a specific case study. Each case study is based on a fictional business scenario and dataset.

2. Case Studies: For each case study, participants are provided with a dataset (often in the form of a CSV file) and a detailed problem description. The problem description outlines the objectives and questions that participants need to address using SQL queries.

3. SQL Queries: Participants are required to write SQL queries to analyze the given data and answer the questions posed in the problem description. These queries involve various SQL operations such as SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and more.

4. Progressive Complexity: The challenges are designed to increase in complexity as the weeks progress. This allows participants to build on their knowledge and skills, gradually tackling more intricate data analysis tasks.

5. Learning by Doing: By actively engaging with the datasets and solving the challenges, participants gain hands-on experience in working with real data and applying SQL concepts to solve practical problems.

6. Sample Solutions: Each challenge also provides a sample solution (usually in the form of a SQL script) that demonstrates how the problems can be approached and solved. Participants can refer to these solutions to compare their own work and learn different strategies.

7. Community Support: The challenge fosters a sense of community by providing a Discord channel where participants can ask questions, discuss solutions, and collaborate with others who are also taking the challenge.

8. Skill Improvement: Completing the 8WeekSQLChallenge equips participants with a solid foundation in SQL and data analysis, making them more proficient in querying and manipulating data, which are valuable skills in various roles within data-related field
