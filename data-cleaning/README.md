## Introduction

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets to ensure that the data is accurate, reliable, and ready for analysis. In this project, I leverage the capabilities of MySQL to clean and preprocess data effectively.

## Project Overview

In this project, I work with a housing dataset that contains various data quality issues, such as missing values, duplicates, concatenated data, and outliers. The goal is to demonstrate how to clean and transform this raw data into a structured and accurate dataset suitable for analysis.

## Techniques Used

I have employed a range of SQL techniques and functions to clean the data, including:

* Identifying and handling missing values
* Correcting inaccurate or inconsistent values
* Breaking out data in a single column into various columns
* Removing duplicate records
* Removing unused columns
